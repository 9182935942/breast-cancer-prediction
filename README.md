**Technologies Used**
 **Machine Learning Models**:  
   **Logistic Regression (97% Accuracy)**
   **Decision Tree (93.5% Accuracy)**
 **Data Processing Libraries**:  
  - Pandas, NumPy  
 **Visualization Tools**:  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Dataset**
 Medical records containing tumor features.
 **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and selection.
 
 **Results**
 **Logistic Regression** performed best with **97% accuracy**, showing reliable classification of breast cancer cases.
 **Decision Tree** model achieved **93.5% accuracy**, useful for interpretability.
